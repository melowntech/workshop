`VTS Mapproxy <https://github.com/melown/vts-mapproxy>`_ is a HTTP server that
converts non-VTS resources (raster or vector) to VTS resources (:ref:`surface`,
:ref:`bound layer <bound-layer>` and :ref:`free layer <free-layer>`) on the fly.

For the first time setup it is recommended to install and run mapproxy as a part of :ref:`vts-backend` package or using :ref:`docker` container which relieve you from the server configuration.
